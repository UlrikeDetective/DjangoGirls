New Year, Same Me (But With More Coffee and Code!)

Let's be real, my 'daily' diary usually sees about one entry per decade. So for a fresh start, I'm launching daily sketches instead – giving my rusty artistic skills a glow-up and officially making friends with my Adobe apps.

As I sit here sipping on a steaming cup of coffee, surrounded by the chaos of my apartment (aka "the cleaning project" that never seems to 
end - thanks to my vast collection of... well, things).

Next goal for the year: Improving my skills in Python, R, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and all things coding. Oh, the sweet agony of learning new stuff!

But life got in the way, as it often does. Data cleaning became my arch-nemesis, leaving me feeling more stuck than a city bus in rush hour (pun absolutely intended). And speaking of silver linings and small wins, let's not forget the mic drop moments – like slaying that Forbes analysis on Kaggle or Google Maps API to the rescue.

And seriously, those Paris Bistro chairs I bought? Finally, my cute, tiny kitchen (and those chairs!) has become my morning sanctuary – perfect for a quick breakfast and, of course, a tall latte macchiato.

As January drew to a close, I couldn't help but reflect on what had been accomplished (or not). 
Coursera courses? Done! Yoga and meditation? Nailed it! Coffee intake? Under control (mostly)!

As I close this chapter on January, I have to make a few decisions. Ibiza or Tarifa? Python or R? And do I drink too much coffee?

Until next time, keep calm and code on (or just drink coffee).
