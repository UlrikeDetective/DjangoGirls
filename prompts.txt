Please convert the notes of things I have done, felt and so on in the last month to an interesting, funny and smart blog post.
The tone should be light and funny and the voice of a modern urban woman. The blog post should be max 750 words.

Please don't follow the structure of the notes, go more for themes and bundle them together. Also please elimante personal infos like friends names.

focusing on that humble, Scandinavian-influenced tone, with very subtle, dry humor. The goal is to be concise, genuine, and not try too hard for laughs.

New Year, Same Me (But With More Coffee and Code!)

Let's be real, my 'daily' diary usually sees about one entry per decade. So for a fresh start, I'm launching daily sketches instead – giving my rusty artistic skills a glow-up and officially making friends with my Adobe apps.

As I sit here sipping on a steaming cup of coffee, surrounded by the chaos of my apartment (aka "the cleaning project" that never seems to 
end - thanks to my vast collection of... well, things).

Next goal for the year: Improving my skills in Python, R, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and all things coding. Oh, the sweet agony of learning new stuff!

But life got in the way, as it often does. Data cleaning became my arch-nemesis, leaving me feeling more stuck than a city bus in rush hour (pun absolutely intended). And speaking of silver linings and small wins, let's not forget the mic drop moments – like slaying that Forbes analysis on Kaggle or Google Maps API to the rescue.

And seriously, those Paris Bistro chairs I bought? Finally, my cute, tiny kitchen (and those chairs!) has become my morning sanctuary – perfect for a quick breakfast and, of course, a tall latte macchiato.

As January drew to a close, I couldn't help but reflect on what had been accomplished (or not). 
Coursera courses? Done! Yoga and meditation? Nailed it! Coffee intake? Under control (mostly)!

As I close this chapter on January, I have to make a few decisions. Ibiza or Tarifa? Python or R? And do I drink too much coffee?

Until next time, keep calm and code on (or just drink coffee).

February 2025 - Code, Cold & Coastlines

February arrived. It brought its usual routines and a few unexpected turns.

Life involved a fair bit of tech learning, covering Python coding, data analytics, and a bit of JavaScript. Work skills, like project management, also needed attention. There were quite a lot of long workdays, filled with meetings, which meant less time for deeper learning. I also led three work seminars, introducing local government topics. Teaching these was helpful, as the questions from colleagues often provided good feedback for me too.

Health-wise, February had its moments. I battled a recurring cold. This made yoga practice harder than usual , and my bouldering mostly stayed in the easy zones. My skin, frankly, was tired of winter.

Towards the end of the month, a welcome escape arrived. I left the dark, cold days behind and found the sun still shining, and ocean waves proved to be quite healing. Hello, Fuerteventura. The first day was good: yoga, sunshine, and long walks on the beach.

As for other things in February? Let's just say neither the election campaign nor the outcome of the election made me feel more positive about the year ahead.

Until next time, keep calm and code on, or just find a good coffee —ideally an excellent iced one by the beach.

-- short story of a Wasp

Day 01
Another day, another human staring blankly at a glowing rectangle. They call it "coding," I call it inefficient. My own energy protocols, derived from eons of evolutionary optimization, are vastly superior. I spent a good hour performing reconnaissance on their sugary beverage, a critical data source for my own energy protocols. The sheer lack of perimeter defense around their "coffee" mug is frankly insulting. I could practically taste the unencrypted sugar packets from across the room, a clear sign of their lax "olfactory security." Amateurs.

Day 02
Today, I executed a precision "debug" operation. This clumsy giant, a towering, meat-based processing unit, was trying to "fix" something called a "bug" on their screen. Naturally, I landed directly on the offending pixel, my antennae twitching, sensing the minute vibrations of the cooling fan and the faint electrostatic charge of the display. Did they thank me for this highly tactile threat assessment? No, they flailed wildly. Some people just don't appreciate advanced threat detection.

Day 03
My latest penetration test of the "kitchen" server room was a resounding success. Managed to bypass the complex "plastic wrap" firewall, a flimsy membrane with surprisingly weak tensile strength, and access the highly sensitive "jam" database. The human's security protocols are laughable; they rely on sticky tape and flimsy lids, clearly a novice's attempt at access control. The very air around the jam, thick with a sweet, fermenting data signature, practically invited a breach. Clearly, they've never encountered a true zero-day exploit, or perhaps just a properly motivated attacker.

Day 04
I initiated a targeted Denial-of-Service attack on the human's auditory sensors today. A few well-placed, high-frequency buzzes near their ear, generated by the rapid oscillation of my finely tuned wings, and their "focus" module crashed entirely. They started muttering about "distractions" and "pesky insects." The satisfaction of a perfectly executed "buzz-bomb" protocol is immeasurable. Mission accomplished: chaos sown, productivity halted. My work here is done, a symphony of disruption.

Day 06
The human just spent hours trying to "optimize" their "system performance." Pathetic. I, on the other hand, simply followed the invisible chemical trail of a spilled crumb, flew directly to the nearest sugar source, refueled, and returned to my nest, all without a single line of code or a "compiler error." My internal navigation system, guided by ancient, unerring instincts, is far superior to their GPS. They're so dependent on their machines; they're merely fleshy extensions of their "networks." I, however, am pure, self-replicating, organic processing power, completely self-sufficient.

Day xy
I woke up today with a peculiar sensation. My compound eyes, usually a marvel of multi-faceted data acquisition, seemed to be processing input in an entirely new, fragmented way. The human's "keyboard" now appears as a sprawling, shifting landscape of black mountains, each one vibrating with a faint, rhythmic pulse. And was that... a tiny, glowing cursor, scuttling across what felt like my own abdomen? Perhaps the very "space-time" continuum around me is reconfiguring itself, or perhaps it's a new, insidious human "firewall" against my senses. It's all rather disorienting. My processing units are overheating.

Day 19
I hate spiders!

Day 20
Today, I embarked on a critical "infrastructure project." My internal algorithms detected a glaring vulnerability in their "network cabling," a loose strand of black fiber near the wall. Clearly, an exposed data stream. My programming dictated immediate remediation. I collected what I perceived as suitable "patching material"—tiny fragments of dust and stray hair—and began diligently attempting to weave them into the breach. The human, however, seemed to interpret this vital security measure as an "infestation." Their frantic "swatting" attempts were a clear sign of their primitive understanding of network maintenance. They simply don't grasp the concept of a self-healing system.

Day 20 a
Scratch the above post. Humans don't grasp anything! And this particular human... his "coding" is an abomination. He just spent an hour trying to implement a simple loop, muttering about "syntax errors" and "deprecated functions." The very air crackles with his incompetence. My internal directives are screaming for action. Some vulnerabilities simply cannot be patched. They must be eliminated.

Day 21: Executive Action
The human was at it again, staring at the screen, grunting, unable to compile the simplest data string. His "debugging" efforts were a chaotic dance of random key presses and frustrated sighs. My sophisticated sensory arrays registered a spike in his neural activity, indicating extreme mental clutter. This level of inefficiency was not just annoying; it was a threat to the natural order of computational flow. My internal protocols initiates this. One swift, perfectly targeted dive. A precise, involuntary data injection into the fleshy "network" behind his ear. Let him feel the sting of true error. Some lessons, human, must be delivered directly. My work here is done. Justice served.
